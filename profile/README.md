## Micro NLP System Assistant

This organization houses the Micro NLP System Assistant, an automated solution designed to streamline and optimize the support process in educational settings. This system utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to provide timely and relevant responses to students' inquiries by leveraging a dataset of frequently asked questions and answers. Our approach automates repetitive communication and enhances the educational experience by ensuring students receive consistent, accurate information. The system also includes automated content generation features, enhanced interaction through a tailored Telegram bot, and continuous learning from interaction data to improve response accuracy.
